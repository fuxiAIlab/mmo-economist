# The MMO Economist: AI Empowers Robust, Healthy, and Sustainable P2W MMO Economies
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/679947564.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10795719)

This repo is the official implementation of The MMO Economist. 
The MMO Economist is an economic simulation environment that facilitates the correspondence between real-world economic systems and their virtual counterparts for authentic and realistic assessments of MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online Game) economic evolution.

## Requirements
The code has been tested running under Python 3.8.16, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
- gym==0.21
- tensorflow==1.14
- ray[rllib]==0.8.4
- importlib-metadata==4.13.0

## Running
GYM-style environment for using in practice:
```python
import foundation

env_config = {}
env = foundation.make_env_instance(**env_config)

obs = env.reset()
for t in range(env.episode_length):
  # random actions
  actions = env.sample_random_actions(obs)
  # perform actions and get feedbacks
  obs, rew, done, info = env.step(actions)
  # do other things

```

## Components
- Economic Resource
  - **EXP**: Non-negotiable incorporeal game assets, acquired directly from the game and used solely by the player oneself, without trading possibilities.
  - **MAT**: Negotiable corporeal game assets, directly obtained from the game and tradable with others.
  - **TOK**: Any item that can function as a general equivalent to all goods and services in games, obtained directly from the game or through external recharges.
  - **CCY**: Legal tender of a specific country used externally to the game, utilized for recharges to exchange for tokens.
  - **CAP**: Specific (virtual) abilities or scores that players enhance by participating in various game activities.
  - **LAB**: Labor generated by players engaging in game activities during the game.
- Economic Activity
  - **Task**: Any production behavior in which players directly obtain resources through their labor in the game.
  - **Upgrade**: Any consuming behavior of players to improve their capabilities by consuming corresponding economic resources in the game.
  - **Auction**: Any trade behavior involving free trade between players in the game. All tradable economic resources can be traded structured as a continuous double auction.
  - **Shop**: Any trade behavior where players directly purchase commodities from game malls or non-player characters (NPCs) in the game.
  - **Recharge**: Any forex behavior where players make payments in the game, such as IAP.
- Economic Entity: **Agent players with different personalities.**
- Economic Structure
  - **Market Economy**: Free economy without any economic regulation and control.
  - **Planned Economy**: Economy with economic regulation and control by human or AI.

    """Base class for endogenous entity classes.

    Endogenous entities are those that, conceptually, describe the internal state
    of an agent. This provides a convenient way to separate physical entities (which
    may exist in the world, be exchanged among agents, or are otherwise in principal
    observable by others) from endogenous entities (such as the amount of labor
    effort an agent has experienced).

    Endogenous entities are registered in the "endogenous" portion of an agent's
    state and should only be observable by the agent itself.
